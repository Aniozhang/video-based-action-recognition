# video-based-action-recognition
Build a deep learning model that classifies human actions (e.g., walking, jumping, waving) from video sequences using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal sequence modeling.
